I'm a trained Computer Science specialist with a BSc and soon to achieve MSc in Computer Science. The majority of my Computer Science education relates to the management and processing of data. My primary interests lie in finding explainations for the behaviour of fundamental (foundational) Machine Learning techniques and then using this analysis to improve training algorithms, or at the intersection of Machine Learning and the natural sciences. 

Despite my primary interests, which require the use of mostly Python, its associated software stack, and sometimes C++, I also have experience in a number of languages spanning multiple paradigms e.g. Java, Solidity, ARM Assembly, Verilog, Prolog.

I'm a passionate problem-solver, and endevour learn as much as possible in cross-disciplinary tasks. My projects can be found on my [Github Page](https://github.com/HarveySouth) or listed on my [Projects](/projects/) page.

## Hobbies
My hobbies include [Ultimate Frisbee](images/ulti_photo.jpg), Video Games, Language Learning, and [playing Saxophone](images/sax_photo.jpg).
